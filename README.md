## CodinGame

This repo contains my solutions for solo puzzles at [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/), mostly in Java, some in PHP as well.

You will also find a few basic endeavors on other, open ended puzzle types like multiplayer AI challenges, contests and optimizations (eg. code golfing).

The code quality is far from high standard: i usually just achieved to make them work, so it lacks any effort on design, however comments may help you understand how it works.
